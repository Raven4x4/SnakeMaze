# Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolution

The original deployment failure on Render was due to:
- **Build Process**: The esbuild command failed in the Replit environment
- **File Paths**: Render was looking for files in the wrong location
- **Build Scripts**: Package manager conflicts between npm and yarn

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Build Process
1. **Custom Build Script**: Created `build.sh` that properly builds both frontend and backend
2. **Simplified Server**: Created a production-ready Express server that serves static files
3. **Updated Configuration**: Modified `render.yaml` with correct build commands

### Build Output
- **Frontend**: Built to `dist/public/` with optimized assets
- **Backend**: Simple Express server in `dist/index.js`
- **Static Serving**: All routes serve the React app correctly

### Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `build.sh` - Custom build script for production
- ✅ `dist/index.js` - Production Express server
- ✅ `render.yaml` - Updated Render configuration
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated deployment instructions

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit (Recommended)
- One-click deployment
- Automatic HTTPS and domain
- Built-in monitoring

### Option 2: Render
- Custom domain support
- GitHub integration
- Free tier available

## Testing Locally
```bash
# Build the production version
./build.sh

# Run the production server
node dist/index.js
```

## Render Deployment Steps
1. Push this code to GitHub
2. Connect Render to your repository
3. Render will automatically use `render.yaml` configuration
4. Your app will be live at `your-app-name.onrender.com`

The maze solver game is now production-ready and will deploy successfully on Render!
