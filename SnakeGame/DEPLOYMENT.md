# Deployment Instructions for Render

## Issue: Old UI Showing on Render
If your Render deployment is showing the old simple UI instead of the new glass morphism design, follow these steps:

### 1. Force New Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger rebuild
echo "# Force rebuild $(date)" >> VERSION
git add .
git commit -m "Force rebuild for new UI deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Clear Render Cache
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Navigate to your service
- Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"

### 3. Verify Deployment
After deployment, check:
- Visit `/api/health` endpoint to verify version 2.0.0
- Look for "Smart Maze Solver v2.0.0" in console logs
- New UI should show:
  - Glass morphism panels
  - Gradient buttons
  - Settings panel on the left
  - Statistics display
  - A* algorithm status messages

### 4. Browser Cache
If still showing old UI:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (PC) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private mode

### Current Version Features
✅ A* pathfinding algorithm
✅ Glass morphism UI design
✅ Real-time statistics
